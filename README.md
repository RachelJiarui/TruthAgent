## Behind the Name
Veritas is a Latin word. It represents the pursuit of truth, honesty, and integrity. Veritas is the cornerstone of knowledge and intellectual inquiry, where the pursuit of truth is essential for advancing understanding, fostering innovation, and making informed decisions. In a broader sense, Veritas serves as a guiding principle for individuals and societies. It encourages critical thinking, skepticism of falsehoods, and the courage to stand by the truth, even when it is challenging or unpopular. In today's world, where misinformation can easily spread, the value of Veritas is more important than ever.

Veritas is more than just a word; it embodies a fundamental human aspiration to seek, understand, and uphold the truth.
